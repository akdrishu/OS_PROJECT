# OS_PROJECT
Q3) Write a multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm. Create n threads that request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant the request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. It is important that shared data be safe from concurrent access. To ensure safe access to shared data, you can use mutex locks.
